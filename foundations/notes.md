## Introduction

### [Leveraging Machine Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/applied-machine-learning-foundations/leveraging-machine-learning?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&resume=true)

- The amount of data generated by machines and humans is mind-boggling and it's growing faster than it ever has
- According to IBM, 90% of the data ever created was created in the last two years
- The challenge is that a lot of this data is completely unstructured and really messy
- Maybe there simply is just too much data to even know how to extract the value out of it

### [What you Should Know](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/applied-machine-learning-foundations/what-you-should-know?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false)

What you should know to get the most out of this course:
- [x] Basic Python knowledge
- [x] Basic experience with NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn

Helpful to Have:
- [x] Basic statistics
- [x] Entry-level data analysis experience
- [x] Familiarity with common machine learning terms

### [What Tools you Need](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/applied-machine-learning-foundations/what-tools-you-need?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false)
- Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda3 installation (version 4.5.12) will include all dependencies needed for this course

### [Using the Exercise Files](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/applied-machine-learning-foundations/using-the-exercise-files?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false)

You are highly encouraged to download and use the exercise files to follow along. Also recommend playing with the code by tweaking it and maybe even purposely breaking it, so you can test the bounds and find out why it did not work.

- The exercise files are broke down into chapters
- Chapter folders are organized into individual lessons
- Within each lesson, there is a `start` folder and an `end` folder
- The start folder contains the notebook that you should start coding in
- The end folder will contain the completed notebook just for your reference
- There is only one dataset for the entire course, and it is in the root directory
